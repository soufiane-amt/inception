Your containers have to restart in case of a crash.

In your WordPress database, there must be two users, one of them being the administrator. 
The administrator’s username can’t contain admin/Admin or administrator/Administrator (e.g., admin, administrator, Administrator, admin-123, and
so forth).

it is strongly recommended to use a .env


our NGINX container must be the only entrypoint into your
infrastructure via the port 443 only, using the TLSv1.2 or TLSv1.3
protocol.


For obvious security reasons, any credentials, API keys, env
variables etc... must be saved locally in a .env file and ignored by
git. Publicly stored credentials will lead you directly to a failure
of the project.

--------------
A Docker container is not a virtual machine. Thus, it is not
recommended to use any hacky patch based on ’tail -f’ and so forth
when trying to run it. Read about how daemons work and whether it’s
a good idea to use them or not.
